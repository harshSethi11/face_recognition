# face_recognition
This project is a Python-based facial recognition attendance system with anti-spoofing capabilities, designed using Tkinter for GUI, OpenCV for video capture, and face_recognition for face embeddings. It ensures secure and automatic attendance logging by verifying a live face and preventing spoofing attempts using a trained anti-spoofing model.
